DeepSea - Hotel Management Web Application
Description

DeepSea is a full-stack hotel management web application built with React (frontend) and Node.js + Express + MongoDB (backend).

Motivation: To create a modern hotel booking and management system where users can explore rooms, make bookings, and handle payments, while admins can manage rooms, users, and transactions.

Why this project: Managing hotel operations manually is inefficient. This project provides a digital solution that is user-friendly and scalable.

Problem it solves: It allows users to easily browse and book hotel rooms online, while admins can oversee all bookings, users, and payments in one centralized dashboard.

What I learned: Building this project improved my skills in full-stack development, authentication, routing, REST APIs, and integration between frontend and backend services.
